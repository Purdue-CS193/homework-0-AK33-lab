## Aakansha Kedia's First CS193 Homework

## My favourite things about CS193
- The instructors are chill, so the class doesn't feel like a class.
- The class is not boring (I can pay attention without the help of coffee haha).
- The instructions for the homework are not ambiguous.
- I feel like I am actually learning something useful from the class.
